        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was created by Elango to demonstrate the principles of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Node.js.</p>
        <h3>What is CI/CD?</h3>
        <p>CI/CD is a set of practices that enable development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. This approach helps automate and streamline the process of integrating and deploying code, making it easier to manage complex projects and quickly deliver updates to users.</p>
        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing manual errors in deployment processes.</li>
            <li>Improving code quality by automating testing and integration steps.</li>
            <li>Accelerating the release of new features and bug fixes.</li>
            <li>Enhancing collaboration between developers and operations teams.</li>
